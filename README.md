## **ðŸŽ¯ Description**

Competitive Programming is a book focused on Competitive Programming (obviously), specifically for the IOI and ICPC competitions (as well as code interviews). The books were written by: Steven Halim, Felix Halim and Suhendry Effendy. The fourth version of the book was divided into two books: Book 1 and Book 2. At the end of each chapter, there is a section with exercises for that particular subject (from the Kattis and UVa platforms). The book does not present solutions to these problems. This repository aims to present the solutions for each exercise in Competitive Programming 4 Book 1 and Competitive Programming 4 Book 2 (solutions created by me and which were accepted by the respective judges).
